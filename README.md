# 🚨 Fall Detector

This device is designed to detect falls in elderly individuals and send alerts to designated contacts. It also tracks daily activities and includes a panic button for emergencies.

## 🏃 Activity Tracking
Activity tracking is achieved through machine learning using the K-means clustering algorithm. Activities are classified into three categories:
- 🏃‍♂️ Running
- 🚶 Walking
- 🛌 Steady

## 🔧 Components Needed
1. ATMega 328p
2. MPU6050
3. SIM800L
4. Buzzer
5. LED x 3
6. 3.7V LiPo battery (1000mAh)

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Download the `falldetection.ino` file and burn it onto an Arduino.
2. Make connections as shown in the circuit diagram.
